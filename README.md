## Steps

### Step 1 - Initial project setup

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nas-tabchiche/sample-express.git
```

2. Create your own repository on Github

3. Change the repote to your repository

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<github-username>/<repo-name>.git
```

### Step 2 - Install and run the application

Requirements:
- Node 22+
- npm
- cURL

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application

```
node app.ts
```

3. Send a GET request to the exposed endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The output should be 'Hello, Kubernetes!'

### Step 3 - Dockerize and publish the image

1. Write a Dockerfile

2. Build your image with the `sample-express` tag

```bash
docker build . -t <username>/sample-express
```

3. Publish the image on dockerhub

```bash
docker push <username>/sample-express
```

### Step 4 - Create and expose your first deployment

1. Write a `deployment.yaml` file containing the information about your deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-express-deployment
spec:
  ...
```

2. Write a `service.yaml`fiel containing the information about your service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sample-express-service
spec:
```

3. Apply your deployment and service

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

4. Check that your pods are running

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

> [!NOTE]
> Their status should be 'Running'. It might take a few seconds to get there.

5. Expose your application

```bash
# If you use minikube
minikube service sample-express-service --url
```

6. Send a GET request to the exposed endpoint

```bash
curl <URL of the exposed service>
```

The output should be 'Hello, Kubernetes!'

### Step 5 - Create an ingress

1. Write a `ingress.yaml` file describing your ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: sample-express-ingress
spec:
  ...
```

2. Apply your ingress

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

3. Check that your ingress is operational

```bash
kubectl get ingress
```

4. Send a GET request to the ingress

```bash
curl --resolve "<ingress-host>:80:<ingress-address>" -i http://<ingress-host>/
```
